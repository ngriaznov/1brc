# Rust Implementation of the 1 Billion Row Challenge

This repository contains my personal implementation of the [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) using Rust. It's important to note that the official challenge only supports submissions in Java, so this Rust implementation is purely an exercise and not an official submission.

## Project Overview

The 1 Billion Row Challenge is a test of programming and data processing skills, aiming to process one billion rows of data as quickly as possible. My implementation in Rust showcases the language's capabilities in handling large-scale data processing.

### Performance

On an i9-12900K CPU with 16GB of RAM, this Rust implementation has achieved a processing time of 5.6 seconds, demonstrating the efficiency and speed of Rust for data-intensive tasks.

### External Dependencies

To optimize the implementation, I've utilized external libraries and tools where appropriate. This approach allows for leveraging existing, highly optimized data structures and algorithms, avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel.
